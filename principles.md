# Chapter 1
## Great Software
```
First, great software must satisfy the customer. The software must do what the customer wants it to do.
```
```
Second, great software is well-designed, well-coded, and easy to maintain, reuse, and extend.

## Enums
A: The cool thing about enums is that methods or classes that use them are protected from any values not defined in the enum. So you can’t misspell or mistype an enum without getting a compiler error. It’s a great way to get not only type safety, but value safety; you can avoid getting bad data for anything that has a standard range or set of legal values.

## Encapsulation
```
Encapsulation is also about breaking your app into logical parts, and then keeping those parts separate. So just like you keep the data in your classes separate from the rest of your app’s behavior, we can keep the generic properties of a guitar separate from the actual Guitar object itself.
```
```
Encapsulation allows you to hide the inner workings of your application’s parts, but yet make it clear what each part does.

## Delegation
```You can use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexible.```
